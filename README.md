Figuring out Github and what a repository is
Hello, I hope I am doing this right haha. My name is Joelle Ataya and I am a 2L at Suffolk Law. I have coding experience using R, but that is it. My brother is an electrical and computer engineer and knows a lot about coding, so my goal is to show off my skills to him once my project is complete!
